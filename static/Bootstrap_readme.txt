adding bootstrap messes up the labels on trips (all files display at once) so just took the relevant parts such as .alert and .alert-info for the css and put them in common.css

and built a custom bootstrap version at http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/customize/ including just the alert dismissal jquery plugin and included a link to that in my layout.html.
