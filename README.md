A transcriptome browser for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq data

Trips-viz is a transcriptome browser designed to visualize Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data at the level of a single gene/transcript isoform as opposed to at the genome level. Trips-viz also provides you the ability to vizualize data from a gene under different conditions, get meta-information at an individual dataset level such as read length distribution or triplet periodicity, and provides the ability to find differentially expressed or translated genes.
